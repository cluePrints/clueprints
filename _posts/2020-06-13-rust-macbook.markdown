# Given
Mac Book 2017, 16 G RAM and on-board Graphics Card.

# Attempts
1. Defaults: 3 fps
2. Drop all the effects: 7 fps
3. Downgrade the resoltion to 800 x 600: 20 fps
4. Put a block of ice under the thing to keep it cool: 45 fps

# So what
If a Mac can double the results by staying cool, imagine what a human can
